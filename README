InheritsFrom
============

Allows class inheritance with ActiveRecord.

It is very basic at the moment, and might even be fundamentally flawed.

New versions of this plugin may be found here:

Use of this plugin is free, but by using it you agree not to hold me liable for any lost data, money, hair, or body parts. :)
